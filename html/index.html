        Opel Kadett debuted back in 1936.But few people know the truth about this amazing car.
        The history of this amazing machine begins about 65 million years ago (when the dinosaurs died out). According to one hypothesis, the cause of the “great extinction” was a blow to our Opel Cadetta 1.8 (this is important, later in the article you will understand why).

    There are hundreds of legends about this car, the most interesting I will tell in the facts.
